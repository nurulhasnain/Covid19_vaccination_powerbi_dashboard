🌍 Just completed a meaningful project that sheds light on the global COVID-19 vaccination progress. 🦠💉

With the data collected from Kaggle, I've created a Power BI dashboard that compiles vaccination statistics from 2020, 2021, and 2023, spanning nations across the globe. The dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of vaccination dates, the number of vaccines administered, and total vaccinations.

If you're curious to explore the insights this dashboard offers, you can access the interactive Power BI file on my GitHub account.

💡 The importance of this dashboard goes beyond data visualization; it's about understanding the progress we've made in the fight against COVID-19. By analyzing trends and patterns, we can better comprehend the global vaccination landscape and its impact on public health.
